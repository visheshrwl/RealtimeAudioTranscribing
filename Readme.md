An intelligent Chrome extension that captures audio from your browser or microphone, provides highly accurate real-time transcription using the Google Gemini API, and optimizes usage with advanced silence detection.

---

## Overview

This extension provides a seamless and efficient way to transcribe audio content directly within your browser. Whether you're in a virtual meeting, watching a lecture, or need to capture your own thoughts, this tool uses a clean side panel interface to deliver live transcripts. The core of its efficiency lies in its **silence detection** capability, which intelligently records only when speech is present, dramatically reducing API costs and focusing on what matters.

## Key Features

* üé§ **Multi-Source Capture**: Transcribe audio from the **active browser tab** (e.g., Google Meet, YouTube) or directly from your **microphone**.
* ü§´ **Intelligent Silence Detection**: The extension analyzes audio in real-time and only records when speech is detected, saving significant API usage and costs.
* ‚è∏Ô∏è **Full Playback Control**: **Start**, **Stop**, **Pause**, and **Resume** your transcription session at any time.
* üåê **Offline Buffering**: If your internet connection drops, the extension automatically saves audio chunks and transcribes them once you're back online.
* üí™ **Robust Error Handling**: Provides clear, user-friendly error messages for API key issues, permission denials, and network failures.
* ‚ú® **Live Audio Playback**: Hear the audio from a browser tab *while* it's being transcribed.
* üìã **Flexible Export Options**: **Copy** the entire transcript, or **download** it as a clean `.txt` or structured `.json` file. You can also **Clear** the transcript at any time.
